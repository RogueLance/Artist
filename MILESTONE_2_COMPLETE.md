# Milestone 2 Complete - Vision System MVP ✅

## Status: COMPLETE

Successfully implemented Milestone 2 - Vision System MVP (Perception and Analysis Engine) for the Cerebrum AI-driven art platform.

**Completion Date:** October 31, 2025

## Purpose

Build the component that observes and interprets the current canvas and references. Its job is not to make decisions but to report structure, error, and alignment.

## Real Artist Parallel

This is the "eye" of the artist. Artists constantly scan their work, comparing proportions, symmetry, value groups, and pose. This system mimics that feedback loop.

```

## VisionModule API

Main interface providing four key methods:

### 1. analyze(image)
Analyze canvas state and extract all features:
```python
result = vision.analyze("canvas.png")
# Returns: AnalysisResult with pose, proportions, symmetry, landmarks
```

### 2. compare_to(canvas, reference)
Compare canvas to reference image:
```python
comparison = vision.compare_to("canvas.png", "reference.png")
# Returns: ComparisonResult with pose differences, similarity scores
```

### 3. detect_pose_errors(canvas, reference)
Find pose and anatomy errors:
```python
errors = vision.detect_pose_errors("canvas.png", "reference.png")
# Returns: List of error descriptions
```

### 4. highlight_areas_needing_refinement(canvas, reference)
Identify problem areas:
```python
areas = vision.highlight_areas_needing_refinement("canvas.png", "reference.png")
# Returns: List of areas with regions, types, and severity
```

## Integration Points

### With Motor System
```python
# Motor creates and saves canvas
motor = MotorInterface(backend="simulation")
motor.create_canvas(800, 600)
# ... draw strokes ...
motor.save("canvas.png")

# Vision analyzes the canvas
vision = VisionModule()
result = vision.analyze("canvas.png")
comparison = vision.compare_to("canvas.png", "reference.png")

# Use analysis to guide further drawing
areas = vision.highlight_areas_needing_refinement("canvas.png", "reference.png")
# ... make corrections based on feedback ...
```

### With Brain System (Milestone 3)
The Vision System provides structured feedback that the Brain System uses for:
- Planning correction strokes based on detected errors
- Prioritizing refinement areas by severity
- Validating artistic decisions against reference
- Iterative improvement cycles with measurable progress

### Complete Workflow
```
1. Motor draws on canvas → canvas.png
2. Vision analyzes canvas state → AnalysisResult
3. Vision compares to reference → ComparisonResult
4. Vision detects pose errors → List[errors]
5. Vision highlights problem areas → List[areas]
6. Brain interprets feedback (Milestone 3) → Tasks
7. Brain plans corrections → ActionPlan
8. Motor executes corrections → Updated canvas
9. Repeat until quality threshold met
```

## Real Artist Parallels

The Vision System mimics human artistic perception:

| Human Artist | Vision System |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Step back and look at the drawing" | `analyze()` - Canvas snapshot and analysis |
| "Check proportions against reference" | `compare_to()` - Reference comparison |
| "The head is too large" | Proportion metrics - Head-body ratio deviation |
| "Left arm is different from right" | Symmetry metrics - Bilateral asymmetry |
| "This doesn't match the pose" | Pose metrics - Keypoint position differences |
| "That area needs work" | `highlight_areas_needing_refinement()` |
| "Focus on the hands first" | Area severity ratings (high/medium/low) |
